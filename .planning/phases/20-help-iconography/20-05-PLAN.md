  <what-built>Global Help entry point + responsive Help modal + shared help/lock/prestige icon language</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run `pnpm dev` and open the game.
2. Desktop: click the help icon in the header; confirm modal opens and is scrollable.
3. Desktop: select a help section, close, reopen; confirm the same section is shown.
4. Mobile: use devtools device emulation (or a real phone). Confirm the Help modal becomes full-screen, the close button is reachable, and content scrolls inside the modal (page behind does not scroll).
5. Spot-check iconography:
   - In Vault, trigger an enjoyment gate (or use any locked gate visible) and confirm the lock icon appears.
   - In Atelier/Maison/Nostalgia, confirm the primary reset/prestige CTA includes the prestige icon.
