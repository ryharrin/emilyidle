# Phase 20: Help & Iconography - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Deliver a universal Help/Glossary entry point and a consistent help/lock/prestige icon language across tabs. This phase clarifies how users access Help, especially on mobile, without adding new gameplay capabilities.

## Implementation Decisions

### Mobile help access
- Help opens as a full-screen modal on mobile/touch devices.
- Help is reachable via a persistent help icon in each tab (top-right or equivalent per tab header).
- The mobile Help modal is optimized for quick glance (lightweight, fast to dismiss).
- Help remembers the last-open section when reopened on mobile.

### Claude's Discretion
- Desktop interaction pattern (modal vs side panel) so long as mobile uses the full-screen modal.
- Exact modal layout, typography, and icon sizing.
- Whether the persistent help icon uses an existing glyph or a new unified icon set.
