# Phase 20-05 Summary

## Outcome
- Desktop Help modal opens from the header, scrolls correctly, and preserves the last selected section after closing/reopening.
- Mobile (<=900px) Help modal renders full-screen, close button stays reachable, and the modal scrolls without scrolling the page behind it.
- Icon cues are consistent: lock icon in Vault purchase gate and prestige icons on Atelier/Maison/Nostalgia reset CTAs.

## Verification Notes
- Performed the manual checklist from 20-05-PLAN.md.
- No usability or accessibility issues observed.

## Follow-ups
- None.
