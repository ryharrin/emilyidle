# UI + selectors
@src/App.tsx
@src/game/state.ts

# Unit tests asserting stats labels
@tests/catalog.unit.test.tsx

**Tech stack available:** React, TypeScript, Vitest
**Established patterns:** Keep `id`/`data-testid` stable; UI copy changes reflected in unit tests
**Constraining decisions:** Avoid selector changes; preserve existing save format
**Issues being addressed:** None

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update Collection UI copy to emphasize enjoyment</name>
  <files>src/App.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Adjust the stats panel to present enjoyment first (labels like "Vault enjoyment" and "Enjoyment / sec") and keep
    cash second. Update collection copy to mention enjoyment before cash. In the watch item cards, include per-watch
    enjoyment rate (via the new helper from `src/game/state.ts`) alongside the existing cash rate, without changing
    any ids, data-testids, or class names.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `pnpm run test:unit -- tests/catalog.unit.test.tsx` after updating copy.</verify>
  <done>Stats and collection copy emphasize enjoyment while keeping cash displayed; selectors remain unchanged.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update stats label assertions</name>
  <files>tests/catalog.unit.test.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Update the stats-metrics text expectations to match the new enjoyment-first labels and ordering. Keep the rest of
    the stats assertions intact.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `pnpm run test:unit -- tests/catalog.unit.test.tsx`.</verify>
  <done>Stats label assertions reflect the new UI copy and pass.</done>
</task>

<success_criteria>

- Enjoyment is presented as the primary currency in stats and collection copy
- Per-watch enjoyment rate is visible alongside cash rate
- Unit tests covering stats labels pass
