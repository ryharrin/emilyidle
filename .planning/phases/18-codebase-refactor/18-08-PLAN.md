<objective>
Perform a manual smoke check of the refactored app after all automated gates are green.

Purpose: Catch any last-mile UX/runtime issues that tests don't cover.
Output: Human-verified confidence that Phase 18 didn't regress core gameplay.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Phase 18 refactor (game module split + UI tabs + runtime hook) with all automated checks passing</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run `pnpm dev`.
2. Open `http://localhost:5173`.
3. Confirm the app loads without console errors.
4. Click through each primary tab: Collection, Career (if visible), Workshop, Maison, Nostalgia (if visible), Catalog, Stats, Save.
5. Confirm the core loop still works: buy at least one watch (if possible), observe currency/enjoyment updates, and confirm Save tab export/import still functions.
6. Refresh the page and confirm state persists (autosave or manual save behavior as implemented).
