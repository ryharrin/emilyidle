# Requirements Archive: v2.0 Upcoming Major Changes to Game Design

**Archived:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED (with known gaps accepted)

This is the archived requirements record for v2.0.

Note: `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` was not present in this repo snapshot during v2.0 execution, so requirement-level traceability is reconstructed from `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, phase summaries, and `.planning/milestones/v2.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`.

---

## Reconstructed Requirement Outcomes

- [x] Enjoyment-first economy (tier-based per-watch enjoyment, UI copy + per-watch display) — Phase 13
- [x] Therapist career cash generation (salary + sessions spending enjoyment; persistence; sim integration) — Phase 14
- [x] Dual-currency watch acquisition (cash spent, enjoyment as gate; Vault messaging + tests) — Phase 15
- [x] Nostalgia prestige loop (earn nostalgia points; reset semantics; UI + tests) — Phase 16
- [x] Nostalgia unlocks (permanent unlock store; strict order/refunds; milestone bypass; tests) — Phase 17
- [x] Codebase refactor (model/data/selectors/actions/runtime + tab extraction; gates) — Phase 18
