### Decisions
| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12-01 | None - followed plan as specified | No deviations |
| 12-02 | None - followed plan as specified | No deviations |
| 12-03 | Keep collector notes gated to owned entries | Preserve discovery + avoid spoilers |
| 12-03 | Use Playwright to assert catalog images load under base URL | Prevent regressions when `base` changes |
| 12-04 | None - followed plan as specified | No deviations |
| 12-05 | None - followed plan as specified | No deviations |
| 12-06 | None - followed plan as specified | No deviations |
| 12-07 | No functional changes required; validated existing UI via unit tests | Coachmarks + dev controls already existed |
| 12-08 | Approved Wind Session design spike and implemented scaled rewards | 5 rounds, tension, Push/Steady choice |
| 12-09 | Added prestige legacy multiplier for workshop resets and maison heritage | Always-on compounding boost |
| 12-10 | Aligned GitHub Pages deploy workflow and verified /emilyidle build output | Pages artifact upload v4 |
| 13-01 | Use explicit per-watch enjoyment rates and sum owned watches | Stable per-watch display and tier-driven enjoyment economy |
| 13-02 | Make enjoyment the primary Collection currency in UI and stats | Align player-facing copy with enjoyment-first economy |
| 14-01 | Therapist earnings are hybrid: passive salary + cooldown sessions; salary affected by events but not the vault softcap | Keeps vault math stable while making "cash / sec" reflect both faucets |
| 14-02 | Gate Career tab via milestone unlock and add stable UI anchors | Preserve fresh-save tabs while exposing therapist progression |
| 15-01 | None - followed plan as specified | No deviations |
| 15-02 | None - followed plan as specified | No deviations |
| 15-03 | None - followed plan as specified | No deviations |
| 16-01 | Set nostalgia prestige threshold to 12,000,000 enjoyment cents with sqrt gain | Diminishing returns keeps rewards monotonic |
| 18-01 | None - followed plan as specified | No deviations |
