## Decision: source-of-truth for fast-foundation sources

- Use `origin/archives/fast-foundation-3` branch as source-of-truth for the `packages/web-components/fast-foundation/src/*` TypeScript implementation files.
- The requested commit `d1cd327a6d37cea742b1b1df48f807fe9a1da4f7` is on `main` and does not contain those sources; it’s still included for permalink purposes per request.
