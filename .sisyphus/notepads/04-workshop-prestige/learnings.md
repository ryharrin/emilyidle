- Removed unused workshop lifetime fields from state and persistence handling.
- `sanitizeState` now persists `workshopUpgrades` to keep upgrades across saves.
- Automation is gated by the `automation-blueprints` workshop upgrade and bulk-buys affordable items on tick.
- Added navigation anchors and an automation toggle for quicker section jumps.
- Workshop tests use seeded localStorage saves via `page.addInitScript` for automation UI coverage.
- LSP diagnostics can flag role/aria suggestions even for simple text edits; re-run `lsp_diagnostics` to confirm cleanliness before testing.
