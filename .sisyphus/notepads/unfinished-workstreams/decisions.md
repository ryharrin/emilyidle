- Time to first Workshop reset: 25 minutes on fresh save.
- Time from first Workshop reset to first Maison reset: 40 minutes.
- Total time to reach stable midgame loop: 120 minutes.
- Tuned pacing: base income 12 (softcap 70k, exponent 0.62), workshop threshold 900k, maison threshold 4.5M.
- Adjusted watch item prices/growth/income/value to smooth early ramp; raised milestone thresholds to 30k value and 55 items.
- Nudged collection bonus steps and upgrade price/multiplier curves for smoother midgame.
- Content pass definition: achievements steady-collector (25 items), vault-elite ($300k value), atelier-spark (workshop prestige ≥ 2); events showcase-week (250k value, 120s, 300s cooldown, 1.45x) and heritage-gala (1.2M value, 150s, 420s cooldown, 1.5x); no new milestones.
